    description: 'Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG "Black Toe" sneakers Supplied by a premier sneaker marketplace dealing with unworn, already sold out, in demand rarities. Each product is rigorously inspected by experienced experts guaranteeing authenticity. Overshadowed by other original Air Jordan 1 colorways like “Bred”, “Chicago” and “Royal”, this “Black Toe” edition is no less important when it comes to the history of the legendary shoe. Worn on court by Michael Jordan during his rookie season, the Air Jordan 1 Black Toe features a similar look to the Chicago colorway, but takes away some of the red from the upper in favor of black on the eyestay and toe panels. This listing is for the 2016 release of the Black Toe Jordan 1, which disappeared from stock immediately wherever it was released. Grab a pair now before they disappear again.',
